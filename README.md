# league
Bloomberg terminal styled client for viewing/updating fantasy sports leagues.

Project currently in progress, tentative plan is:
- Next & Redux client
- Django server for APIs & auth (auth service tbd)
- Yahoo Sports API to fetch Fantasy league information
- Potential RSS feeds to fetch league/team/player news
- Maybe store league meta in Redis for quick access
